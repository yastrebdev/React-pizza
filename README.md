## About project

This is a project created using the `create-react-app`. This is a pizza ordering app (under development).

> **Main stack:** `react`, `redux toolkit`, `typescript`

> **Additional technologies:** `react-router-dom`, `axios`

> The **mockAPI** service is used to host the data

#### Development plans

- [ ] Fix the bugs
- [ ] Make a proper adaptation
- [ ] Make a normal product card
- [ ] Make registration 
- [ ] Make a simple personal account

#### Bugs and bugs of which I am aware

1. If you reduce the quantity of an item in the basket, this will not affect the final price, although the value will change in the state

2. If you add the same pizza with different dough or size - it won't show up in the cart in any way

3. CSS is poorly adapted, but I was focusing specifically on working with react and typescript

4. Pizza search only works where there is pizza
